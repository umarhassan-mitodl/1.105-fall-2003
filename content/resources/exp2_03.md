description: In this experiment, students will verify the consequences of static equilibrium
  for a weight suspended from a cable. In a second part, they will determine the force/deflection
  relationship for a redundant structure built up with two cables under pretension.
  In contrast to the first part, the theory for the second experiment will not be
  provided until later in the course.
