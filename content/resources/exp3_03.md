description: 'The objective of this experiment is to measure the Elastic Modulus of
  steel. The experiment comes in two parts. In the first part of the experiment, students
  will subject an ordinary steel reinforcing rod to a tension test using a testing
  machine designed specifically for that purpose. The BLH machine dates from the 1950s
  but its mechanical subsystems still function well enough for our purposes.

  In the second part, students will do a tension test of a stainless steel rod, loading
  the specimen using the dead weights available in the lab but measuring displacement
  using the LVDT, Linearly Variable Differential Transformer.'
